# What makes GameHub's compatibility better — and how it's ported to GameNative

## TL;DR — the "secret sauce" is not per-game recipes

GameHub does **not** carry a big per-game recipe database (its catalog has ~70 per-game config-file
patches; per-game *dependency* lists are not declared — see below). Its superior compatibility comes from
**the state of the Wine prefix before boot**, on four axes:

1. **A default prefix provisioned with the common Windows runtimes.** GameHub's 114 "dependency
   components" are exactly the **winetricks verb set** (`vcrun2005`–`2022`, `d3dx9`, `d3dcompiler_*`,
   `dotnet20`–`dotnet48`, `physx`, `xact`, `xaudio2.7`, `xinput`, `dmusic`/`directshow`/`quartz`,
   `gdiplus`, `mono`, `oalinst`, `msxml`, `xna31/40`, …). The common ones are baked into its 173 MB
   `imagefs`; more are installed on demand. **This is the single biggest factor.**
2. **Box64 / FEX execution tuning.** `BOX64_DYNAREC=1, BIGBLOCK=2, STRONGMEM=0, WEAKBARRIER=1,
   SAFEFLAGS=0, FASTROUND/FASTNAN=1, NATIVEFLAGS=1`; `FEX TSOEnabled=1, HalfBarrierTSOEnabled=1,
   Multiblock=1, VectorTSO=0`.
3. **Device-aware component selection** — Wine/Proton build, DXVK, VKD3D, Box64/FEX, GPU driver chosen
   per device (Adreno vs generic) and per category from `getAllComponentList` (575 components) +
   `getDefaultComponent`.
4. **Stock Wine/Proton** — no Wine source patches; compatibility is from orchestration + the above, not
   a magic Wine fork.

### Why Mirror's Edge (Steam 17410, UE3 + PhysX) boots under GameHub

Through the **default path**, not a per-game entry. A UE3/PhysX game launched in GameHub lands in a
default container whose prefix has **PhysX + d3dx9 + the VC++ runtimes** present and the Box64/FEX
tuning applied — so it boots. A vanilla GameNative prefix lacks these, so the same game fails before
the renderer initializes. The fix is to **provision the prefix with the same baseline**.

## Catalog model (verified live)

`bannerhub-api.the412banner.workers.dev/v6/simulator/v2/…`:
- `getAllComponentList` → **575 components**: `type` 1=translator(Box64/FEX, 38), 2=GPU driver(292),
  3=DXVK(51), 4=VKD3D(9), 5=game-patch(70), 6=dependency(114), 8=steam-client. Each an
  `EnvLayerEntity{id,name,version,downloadUrl,fileMd5,type,…}`.
- `getDefaultComponent` → recommended dxvk/vkd3d/steamClient/container per category.
- `getContainerList` → 10 Wine/Proton builds (wine9.5–10.6, proton9/10/11, x64 + arm64ec).
- `getImagefsDetail` → the base firmware/imagefs (the pre-provisioned rootfs).
- Per-game data: the 70 type-5 patches are config-file overlays dropped into `drive_c/users/<user>/…`;
  there is **no per-game dependency declaration** — GameHub installs deps just-in-time at launch via
  `IEmuContainer.installDependency(name, …)` (a winetricks reimplementation).

## What is ported into GameNative (this work)

All behind the opt-in `PrefManager.enablePerGameProvisioning` flag; zero regression when off.

| GameHub element | GameNative port |
| --- | --- |
| 114 dependency components = winetricks verbs | **`gamehub-verbs.json`** — 99 verbs seeded from winetricks (download URLs, SHA-256, guest install commands, DLL overrides), loaded into the verb registry. |
| Default-prefix common runtimes | **`gamehub-baseline.json`** recipe — installs VC++ 2005-2022, d3dx9/d3dcompiler, .NET 4.8, PhysX, XAct, XNA, dsound, gdiplus, openal, applied under every game. |
| Box64/FEX tuning defaults | the baseline recipe's `env` (BOX64_DYNAREC_* / FEXCORE_*), applied set-if-absent at launch. |
| 70 per-game config patches | **`gamehub-recipes.json`** — 19 per-game config-file recipes (the ones with meaningful, Steam-matched configs), path-normalized to GameNative's `xuser`. |
| Device branching (Adreno/generic) | the recipe `deviceOverrides` + `DeviceProfile`; resolver applies the matching overlay. |
| 3-stage launch (config → components → deps) | the `RecipeResolver` (precedence: user > GameHub > migrated) + `ProvisioningEngine` (idempotent, transactional) at the `XServerScreen` pre-launch hook. |
| Just-in-time dependency install (`IEmuContainer.installDependency`) | **`ProvisioningDepsStep`** — a `PreInstallStep` that downloads the resolved installer verbs (VC++ 2005-2022, PhysX, .NET 4.8, XNA) from their official vendors (SHA-256-verified) into `C:\.gnprov\<verb>\` and runs them silently in the Wine guest via the existing pre-install chain. |

## Steam DRM (the *other* boot blocker — e.g. Mirror's Edge)

Runtime provisioning does **not** fix Steam-DRM games. A Steam-DRM-wrapped exe shows **"Application
load error 3:0000065432"** when it can't reach a Steam client to validate ownership. This is
orthogonal to VC++/PhysX/.NET.

How GameHub solves it: it ships a full **real Steam client** (an 11 MB Rust reimplementation,
`libsteamkit_core.so`) that logs into the user's real account and serves genuine ownership tickets —
out of scope to replicate. But **GameNative already bundles the open-source answer**: the Goldberg
`steam_api` emulator (`assets/steampipe/`), a cold-client `steamclient` loader, `generateInterfacesFile`,
`ensureSteamSettings`, and Steamless. It exposes three launch paths in `MainViewModel.launchApp`
(real-Steam → restore Valve DLLs; `useLegacyDRM` → Goldberg `steam_api`; default → cold-client
`steamclient`). The missing piece was simply that **none of it is keyed by appid** — a fresh game
defaults to the cold-client path, and for a 2008 title like Mirror's Edge the stub survives.

This work adds that appid-keying declaratively: a recipe's optional **`steamDrm`** block
(`SteamDrmStrategy` = `bionic_steam` | `real_steam` | `legacy_goldberg` | `cold_client` | `auto`) is
applied by `PerGameProvisioning.applyRecommendedDrmOnce()` to the container's *existing* DRM toggles,
**set-once** and **before** `MainViewModel.launchApp` chooses its DRM path — so the user's own
container DRM settings win on every subsequent launch (the earlier version overrode them every launch,
which is why changing the container options "did nothing"). Nothing new is bundled.

**Mirror's Edge (`gamehub-recipes.json`, appid 17410) → `bionic_steam`.** Mirror's Edge is **Steam CEG**
(Custom Executable Generation — Valve's per-user AES-256 executable encryption), *not* SteamStub or
SecuROM. CEG can only be decrypted by a **genuine, logged-in Valve client that owns the game** —
Goldberg only emulates the Steamworks API (it can't decrypt a CEG exe) and Steamless explicitly never
strips CEG. The key realization: **GameNative already has the GameHub-equivalent of a headless Steam
client — its `bionic-Steam` path** runs the genuine Android `libsteamclient.so` in-process, logs in via
the user's JavaSteam token, and shows **no Steam window**. (GameHub had to build this from scratch in
11 MB of Rust, `libsteamkit_core`; GameNative already ships it.) Routing CEG titles to `bionic_steam`
is the headless, GameHub-style fix — not the heavy visible `real_steam` (full `steam.exe`) path, which
remains the fallback. A latent crash on the real/bionic path was also fixed: `restoreSteamApi`
force-unwrapped `userSteamId` and NPE'd offline/token-only; now null-safe via `getSteam3AccountId()`.

**Honest hard limit:** CEG *decryption itself* is performed by Valve's closed `steamclient`. Both
GameHub and GameNative run a genuine client for it; neither reimplements CEG crypto. `bionic_steam`
depends on the device's own `libsteamclient.so` (per-device), so `real_steam` is the portable fallback.

## How the dependency install works (the boot-maker)

GameHub bakes the common Windows runtimes into its base `imagefs`. GameNative ships no such image, so
`ProvisioningDepsStep` provisions the prefix **at launch** instead, reusing the same pre-install chain
that already installs a game's bundled VC++/PhysX redists:

1. **Resolve** — baseline deps (always) + the per-game recipe's deps, de-duplicated. Only verbs whose
   payload is a directly-runnable installer (`.exe`/`.msi`) are run here (`ProvisioningInstallers.INSTALL_FLAGS`);
   DLL-drop verbs (d3dx9, d3dcompiler, xact) are handled declaratively, not by a guest installer.
2. **Download** — each redistributable from its official vendor URL via the app's own `SteamService.fetchFile`,
   SHA-256-verified, staged once per prefix under `drive_c/.gnprov/<verb>/` (so VC++ isn't re-downloaded per
   game). Each download is bounded by a 180 s timeout; a stuck transfer is dropped, never wedging launch.
3. **Install** — the staged installers run silently in the guest (`/q`, `/install /quiet /norestart`,
   PhysX `/s`, `msiexec /i` for MSIs), chained through `chainPreInstallSteps` (markers, `wineserver -k`
   between steps, "Installing prerequisites…" splash).
4. **Idempotent + recoverable** — a per-game marker means each game provisions at most once; if *any* verb
   fails to download/stage, the marker is **withheld** so the whole step retries next launch (cached
   downloads make the retry cheap). "Verify Files" clears the marker to force a clean re-provision.

Fully opt-in (`PrefManager.enablePerGameProvisioning`, default off): when off, `appliesTo` returns false and
there is zero behavior change.

## What still needs on-device validation (human handoff)

The pipeline compiles, unit-tests green, and is wired end-to-end, but the **silent installs + the resulting
boot** can only be confirmed on hardware: the per-verb silent flags are winetricks-faithful facts but are
best-effort on Wine/Box64, and a few runtimes (legacy .NET full installers — `dotnet40/45/46` — deliberately
excluded from auto-run for this reason) are historically fragile under emulation. The Box64/FEX tuning and the
config-file recipes apply declaratively and need no install step.

Concretely, to validate Mirror's Edge (Steam 17410): enable the flag, launch it, and confirm the baseline
installs PhysX + VC++ into the container (watch the "Installing prerequisites…" splash, then check
`drive_c/.gnprov/` and the game's marker) and the game boots — versus flag-off.
